# Responsible AI Guidelines

This checklist ensures that AI-assisted coding (e.g., GitHub Copilot) is used responsibly, ethically, and securely.

## 1. Reviewing and Validating AI-Generated Code
- Always read and understand the code suggested by AI before using it.
- Test the AI-generated code to verify correctness and performance.
- Avoid blindly copying code without checking for bugs or unnecessary complexity.
- Rewrite or improve suggestions when needed to match project requirements.

## 2. Handling Sensitive Data Securely
- Never include API keys, passwords, or personal data in code.
- Store credentials in environment variables, not in source files.
- Do not share sensitive information in prompts given to AI tools.
- Follow proper data protection rules based on your organization's policies.

## 3. Acknowledging AI Contributions Ethically
- Clearly state when AI tools were used to generate code or documentation.
- Ensure that AI suggestions do not violate open-source licensing rules.
- Do not claim full personal authorship for work substantially generated by AI.
- Use phrases like: "This section was assisted using GitHub Copilot" where relevant.
